This code is written to test any serial ports on Arduino Mega 2560 and its variants
using this test code the user can send data to any Serial port from Serial monitor and do the vice-versa.

char val;		// defining a intermediate Character of DataType "Char" and is global in nature.


void setup() //Code in this Section runs only once
{
Serial1.begin(9600); //Set baud for SerialPort1 this is also the PORT under test Replace it with PORT u want to test
Serial.begin(9600);	//Set baud for SerialPort0 Also the PORT used for Debuging and Getting the Response
Serial.println("Initialising..."); // Send message to the terminal window as "Initialising" to tes the main PORT0 initially
}

void loop()	//code under this section runs forever "looped!!!"
{
  
	if(Serial1.available() >0) // Check if Data is available on PORT1
	{
  	val = Serial1.read();	//If data is available put it into the val
  	Serial.print(val);	// the value of the Val is printed on the Serial monitor of Arduino
	}

  	Serial1.print(val);	// the value of the Val is sent to the Device connected to Serial PORT1
